This is assignment project that I wrote in 2015. It's build using VS2016 Community compiler and is using sfml 2 as a graphics library.
It's a game with procedurally generated levels and enemies. Level generation is quite rough and it still requires playing with generation parameters for better balancing. I implemented particle effects for making game more dynamic as there are no sprite animations.
It uses perlin noise for decay effect for the room tiles.
Players can level up and increase their attributes. There are few different classes of enemies.
